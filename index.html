            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <h2>Machine learning intern - Protuner Technologies March 2024- April 2024</h2>
            <p>I developed an iris flower classification model, using neural networks to distinguish between different species of Iris flowers. This model achieved an impressive 99.8% accuracy in classifying Iris species.
                I developed two different models for classifying emails as spam or non-spam. One of these models was based on regression, while the other was a neural network. I used different data sets to train and test the neural network, achieving more than 95% success. It should be noted that this model was trained in less than 3 minutes.
                I developed a neural network that reduces the dimensionality of images of handwritten digits. Additionally, I implemented an additional neural network to classify the reconstructed images.
                This model achieved an 89% reduction in image memory usage, 95% accuracy in the reconstruction of the original images. In addition, I developed an additional neural network with an accuracy of 90% in the classification of reconstructed images.
                I used TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter notebook, and NumPy on All of these projects. </p>

            <h2>Web scrapping with MercadoLibre</h2>
            <p>The process is simple: by entering the name of a product and the number of pages to search, it generates a .csv file with the name of the product entered, which includes the name of the product, price and link.
                Some products on sale still need to be separated, since the price shown is the "main" price and would not show, for now, the offer price.</p>

                <h2>Product Description Generator</h2>
                <p>The process is simple: using a product name, my code uses ChatGPT to automatically generate a detailed and engaging description of each product. This can be useful for companies that need to generate product descriptions quickly and efficiently. But what interests me most about this, and that I wanted to share with you, is the usefulness of using GPT in a wide variety of fields and software.

                    Not only is it applicable for this task of writing product descriptions, but I can think of countless uses that could be given to the integration of GPT in the development of a program, no matter how basic it may be.
                    
                    I think many people use GPT, but using it to automate repetitive tasks where interpretation is required seems totally useful to me!</p>
                    Important: To be able to use it you must enter your OpenAi Api-Key

                <h2>Spam email detection using machine learning</h2>
            <p>  Using natural language processing techniques and a large set of labeled data, I trained the model to recognize key patterns that distinguish between legitimate messages and spam. Some libraries I use are:
                Matplotlib, TensorFlow, NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas and Scikit-learn.
                You can see the code and more in my github link in my profile!
